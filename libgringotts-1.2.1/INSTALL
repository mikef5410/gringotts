			-= libGringotts installation instructions =-

Hi!
	you may have downloaded libgringotts mainly in three forms: the
CVS repository image, the tarball or an RPM file. Here is how to handle
each of them:

							-= CVS=-
							
You can access to cvs repository of Pluto-devel with these data:

CVSROOT:	:pserver:anonymous@cvs.pluto.linux.it:/Devel
password:	anonymous

the directory to checkout is called "gringotts". If you download
libGringotts from CVS, it will miss all the various files generated
by the GNU build tools. So, you need to re-create them. In order
to do this, you'll need:

  Autoconf >= 2.52
  Automake  = 1.4

now, cd to the libgringotts dir and type:

  sh autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make dist

after these steps, you should have in your current directory a file
called libgringotts-x.y.z.tar.gz. Please read the next section to
learn how to handle it.

						  -= Tarball =-

So, you have a tar file, hm? These instructions will deal with a

libgringotts-x.y.z.tar.gz

file; if you've a .tar.bz2 one, you should know how to adapt them to
it. If not, just do a

  bunzip2 libgringotts-x.y.z.tar.bz2
  gzip --best libgringotts-x.y.z.tar

to convert it. Well, please unarchive it and go to its dir:

  tar xzf libgringotts-x.y.z.tar.gz
  cd libgringotts-x.y.z

in order to compile it, you will need:

  libmcrypt (>= 2.4.21)
    http://mcrypt.hellug.gr

  mhash (>= 0.8.13)
    http://mhash.sf.net

the specified package versions are simply those I use; if you have
older versions, libGringotts may or may not compile. Once checked this,
do a simple

  ./configure
  make
  make check
  make install

sequence to build, check and install it.

To build an RPM package from the tarball, simply do:

  rpm -tb --clean libgringotts-x.y.z.tar.bz2

or, in a rpm 4.1-based system such as RedHat 8.0,

  rpmbuild -tb --clean libgringotts-x.y.z.tar.bz2

to build a binary package; notice that you'll need the bz2 tarball
(simply recompress it if you have a gz one). "-ts" will build a
source RPM. After this, read on.

							-= RPM =-

Finally, let's suppose you have an RPM. libGringotts behave just normally,
so to compile a source RPM you'll do:

  rpm --rebuild libgringotts-x.y.z-1.src.rpm

or, in a rpm 4.1-based system such as RedHat 8.0,

  rpmbuild --rebuild libgringotts-x.y.z-1.src.rpm

To specify some configure flags for the compilation process, set the
variable $GRG_COMPILE_FLAGS:

  GRG_COMPILE_FLAGS="--with-gnu-ld" rpm --rebuild [...]

To install the binary ones, you can do:

  rpm -Uvh libgringotts-x.y.z-1.i386.rpm
  rpm -Uvh libgringotts-devel-x.y.z-1.i386.rpm

easy, ain't it? Here we are, have fun!
