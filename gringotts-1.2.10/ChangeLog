    --------------------------------
   --- Changes from release 1.2.8 ---
    --------------------------------

2005-05-14 Mano <mano78@users.sourceforge.net>

	* applied shlomif-3 patches, which enable compilation on newer
		systems and add a few nice features
	* added russian and polish translations
	* improved german translation
	* the spec file isn't maintained anymore directly by me

2006-03-28 Shlomi Fish <shlomif@iglu.org.il>
	* Fix a data corruption bug with the search function.
	* Fix the "Find again" functionality.
	* Eliminate many compilation warnings caused due to a confusion between 
	signed and unsigned char strings.
	* Integrated a patch by wwp that:
		* Fixes proto for find() in src/grg_entries_vis.h (not really used anyway)
		* Fixes compilation on FC3 (missing #includes to stdio.h)
		* Adds sensitivity to HTAB environment variable to change the 
		horizontal tab value in the main edition widget (default: 8)

2006-04-04 Shlomi Fish <shlomif@iglu.org.il>
	* Fix a data corruption bug caused by the previous data corruption bug
	fix, in which before the search the entry's widget's text was not synced 
	into memory.

2007-01-01 Shlomi Fish <shlomif@iglu.org.il>
	* Made sure that the "Preferences" dialog does not crash gringotts, due
	to saying "g_free (fdesc)" instead of 
	"pango_font_description_free (fdesc)".
	* Released as gringotts-shlomif-0.4.4

2007-10-04 Shlomi Fish <shlomif@iglu.org.il>
	* Added the autogen.sh file to generate the autotools helpers.
	* Ported the source code to gtk+-2.12.
	* Applied 02_pixmap_32x32.dpatch from the Debian package. It adds
	a gringotts-32.xpm pixmap.
	* Applied 06_check_regcomp_ret.dpatch from the Debian package. It
	makes the regular expression check for the environment variables in
	grg_safe.c more robust, and fixes a bug with the display environment.
	* Applied a modified version of 07_check_ulimit.dpatch from the Debian
	package. This makes sure that there is a good enough
	RLIMIT_MEMLOCK in the ulimit for the mlockall operation.
	* Applied a modified version of 09_check_key.dpatch from the Debian
	package. The description reads:
	{{{{{{
	## DP: Fix invalid gfree() from load_file. And make sure the
	## DP: to-be-freed verkey is not NULL.
	}}}}}}
	* Replaced C++-style comments ("//") with C-style comments ("/* ... */").
	* Eliminated some warnings (by inspiration and code from
	13_compiler_warnings.dpatch from the Debian package).
	* Fixed the load_file() function - abs_filename could have been
	NULL if the path was already absolute. This was a regression caused
	by applying a Debian patch. "Save" (not "Save as") now works.

2007-10-08 Shlomi Fish <shlomif@iglu.org.il>
	* Tagged and released gringotts-1.2.9pre2

2007-12-07 Shlomi Fish <shlomif@iglu.org.il>
	* Integrated the README.Debian into the README with a note of my own.

	mlock-memory.

	* Tagged and released gringotts-1.2.9pre3

2008-01-04 Shlomi Fish <shlomif@iglu.org.il>
	* Applied a patch from wwp to remember the main window size
	between invocations.
	* Fixed "configure.ac" (and by implication - "configure") to require
	gtk+ version 2.12.0 and above, to avoid compilation problems with
	older and incompatible gtk+'s.
	* Tagged and released gringotts-1.2.9pre4

2008-01-25 Shlomi Fish <shlomif@iglu.org.il>
	* Tagged and released gringotts-1.2.9. (With no significant changes
