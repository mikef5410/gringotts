If you remove a floppy disk during reading, the program will exit with a
SIGBUS error. Not so kind of it, uhu?

It all occupies just too much memory. Moreover, it's mlock()ed, so the
program lives always on the edge... :(

If you open the pref windows and press OK without change anything, the file
becomes saveable even if you didn't actually make any modification. I'm sorry, 
but the severity of the problem isn't worth the complexity of the fix, IMHO.

When opening files with non-latin1 filenames, the title of the window in some
cases (i.e. in RH 8.0+) won't display properly. This seems to be more GTK+ than
Gringotts-related.

If you open a file, and switching to a different sheet, without making
modifications and saving it again, and then re-open it - then gringotts will
load the original sheet. This is because the current sheet identifier is stored
in the file, and the file is not saved. For now, a temporary workaround is to
make a small and meaningless modification in the new sheet, and then save the
file.

With some 2.6.9 and 2.6.10 kernels, Gringotts segfaults. Please remove the
setuid bit from the executable when running on such systems.
